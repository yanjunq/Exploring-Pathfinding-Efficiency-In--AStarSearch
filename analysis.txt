In the second test,b, if you change cost function from Step to StepTurn, what do you expect to get for the counts? What did you get? Interpret and explain the differences between a, b, and the switch of cost function. 

Switching from the "Step" to "StepTurn" cost function in the A* algorithm, which adds additional costs for turns, resulted in a decrease in the number of explored rooms from 104 to 79, while maintaining the path count at 72. This suggests that the introduction of turn costs led A* to prioritize more direct paths with fewer turns, enhancing exploration efficiency by avoiding less optimal, turn-intensive paths. The unchanged path count indicates that the optimal path's length remained consistent, focusing solely on minimizing unnecessary movements. In contrast, Greedy's counts remained unchanged, suggesting its heuristic-driven pathfinding already minimized turns effectively. Thus, the switch to "StepTurn" underscores the impact of incorporating realistic movement costs into pathfinding algorithms, optimizing their performance by penalizing less efficient maneuvers.
